    "1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only\n",

    "implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Control**: Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private and \n",
    "writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables. To implement encapsulation, you can use \n",
    "tools known as access modifiers: public, private, and protected. These determine who can access the data and methods \n",
    "in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity**: Encapsulation is also used to protect information from being modified or having new errors \n",
    "introduced. When you store and lock the information in a bundle, it is much more difficult for users to accidentally \n",
    "modify the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes using the data hiding concept \n",
    "which is achieved by making the members or methods of a class private, and the class is exposed to the end-user or \n",
    "the world without providing any details behind implementation using the abstraction concept.\n",

    "In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes using the data hiding concept which is achieved by making the members or methods of a class private, and the class is exposed to the end-user or the world without providing any details behind implementation using the abstraction concept, so it is also known as a combination of data-hiding and abstraction. Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables. It is more defined with the setter and getter method\n",
